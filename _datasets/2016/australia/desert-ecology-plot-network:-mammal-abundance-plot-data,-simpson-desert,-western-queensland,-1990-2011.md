This mammal abundance trap data package comprises capture data for a specified duration of trapping nights in the Simpson Desert, Western Queensland. Captured mammal fauna were identified and recaptures during the same session were removed (i.e. individuals were only counted once). Date, site and grid number were recorded for all captures, and captured animals were also marked by a unique ear notch prior to their release to identify recaptures. The network program uses a core of 12 sites. The trapping survey aims to quantitatively track long-term shifts in biodiversity and ecological processes in relation to key drivers, including unpredictable rainfall and droughts, fire, feral predators and grazing.
