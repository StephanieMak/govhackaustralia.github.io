I am a highly driven individual motivated by people, passion and results. This mindset coupled with my analytical nature has enabled me to approach problems clearly and deliver strong outcomes for clients; particularly in the field of sales. During my time at AIESEC, for example, I led our Incoming Exchange division and partnered with businesses to provide them with a high quality, global talent solution. As a result, they were able to maximise their scope for global expansion.

Currently, in this stage of my career, I have joined the Digital Sales team at IBM and will be commencing their Global Sales School shortly where I will be developing critical seller capabilities as a certified IBM seller. Overall, I am eagerly learning about the whole IBM business and making a meaningful contribution.
