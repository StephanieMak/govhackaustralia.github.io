I'm an Information Technology professional with comprehensive knowledge of programming, software architectures and Big Data. I have been in the IT field for over 12 years, working mainly on large-scale and high-load projects under Agile environments. 

As a graduate from the University of Sydney with Masters of Information Technology Management, I'm obsessed with the possibilities of using technology and data to solve complicated problems. I'm also a certified Master Practitioner of Neuro-Â­Linguistic Programming (NLP) with strong business coaching skills. 

I'm currently CTO/Head of Product at OurSay. At OurSay we deliver an online community engagement platform that is designed to connect decision-makers with communities to improve community dialogue, satisfaction and customer service.
