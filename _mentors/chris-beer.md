I head up the Australian Bureau of Statistics mentoring team for GovHack. Specifically I can tell you about SDMX (an exchange model and format for exchanging data) and other standards, how to use our API's and services, technical questions around the internet and web development, and online architecture.

I can also point you to our Statistical experts on any of our datasets, and, as a bonus, help you brainstorm ideas about anything. (Literally.)
