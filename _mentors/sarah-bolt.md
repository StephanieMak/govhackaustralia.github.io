I am the Senior Data Scientist for the Digital Network division at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).  I have nearly a decade of study and experience in advanced analytical methods, statistical models and data visualization.   I have worked on projects from disease outbreak detection and natural-disaster risk prediction to marketing propensity models and content recommendations.  My interests lie particularly in where we can put data at the core of automated systems and decisions. |
