Betty Machalias has been working in the NSW public sector for more than 25 years in the human services, education and transport sectors. Betty has extensive experience in the development of performance metrics, performance monitoring and public reporting. Currently, she is managing the development and publication of online interactive dashboards for FACS. She has worked on a variety of projects including state and national data working groups and understands the importance of performance measures in communicating the statistical narrative for any organisation.
