After completing a Bachelor of Environmental Studies, I joined the Australian Bureau of Statistics and have been working there for the past 8 years. I have spent much of this time working with demographic statistics (producing small area population estimates)and now work in the National Migrant Statistics Unit, which has a focus on developing an understanding of migrant settlement outcomes.
