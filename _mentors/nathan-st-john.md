I'm currently a Graduate at the ABS, and love being surrounded by colleagues  who are passionate about data, statistics and serving the public. Previously I have worked as a Data Analyst and Research Analyst in the private and tertiary sectors. I studied Psychological Science at UQ, and have recently developed an addiction to learning data science and programming in the R package.
