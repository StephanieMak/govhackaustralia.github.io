I have a public policy background with 15 years experience in social policy development, particularly related to the tax/transfer system and employment services for disadvantaged job seekers. ||I am currently working on strategic projects in the Department of Employment to develop our data management capability and to have our evidence published in a systematic way. The aim is to support evidence-based policy development and service delivery design and develop external partnerships to work across traditional boundaries.
