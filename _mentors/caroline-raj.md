I have spent my professional career doing what I love most - building creative, innovative and results oriented marketing for brands in Australia, UK and Europe. 

I have worked with a number of the world's most successful international brands and local brands and have even set up my own parenting blog/ business. I am the Melbourne Marketing Executive at IBM and passion is to drive marketing transformation initiatives with clients to engage their customers more deeply and across multiple channels by leveraging their brand, culture and data
