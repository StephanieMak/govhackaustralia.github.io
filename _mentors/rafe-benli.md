I work in place names for the Victorian government. The majority of roads, features and localities are gazetted and registered via the Office of Geographic Names. This information filters into VICNAMES - The Register of Geographic Names and Vicmap products. VICNAMES enables the users to upload historical information to any of the 200,000 roads and any of the 40,000 features. I ensure compliance to the Guidelines for Geographic Names and manage projects for the Office and provide advice on naming and addressing to naming authorities, typically councils, government departments and the public.
