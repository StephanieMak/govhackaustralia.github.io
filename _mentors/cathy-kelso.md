I prepared most of the datasets that State Library of WA  (SLWA) has on offer for GovHack.  I am familiar with SLWA's data preparation and processes.

I'm a librarian by profession - I work in the team that maintains the library catalogue system.  Not particularly geeky, though this word is often attributed to me.  I married a true geek so I know what I am talking about.

I am powered by chocolate and the love of cats.
