I work to help businesses, communities and regions make the most of the digital economy and technologies on offer.  My passion is for rural and regional Queensland, bridging the digital divide that exists across Queensland.

I especially love working with those that would love to use digital to their full potential but don't have the access to the technology & means (for whatever reason). Just as rewarding is opening the eyes and minds of those that have the access and don't use it to their full potential.
