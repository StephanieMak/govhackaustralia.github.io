Part of our team's work at BoM is building a Python package for the analysis and verification of weather forecasts against observations. I am mainly a developer, but also involved in other scientific and technological aspects of our work. I was heavily involved in the preparation of our dataset.

I come from a background of computational chemistry. I am happy to chat about the BoM dataset, anything data science, statistics, tools for analytics, Python, or simply life in general.
