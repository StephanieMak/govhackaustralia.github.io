I joined the National Migrant Statistics Unit (NMSU) after 2011 Census where I was responsible for planning and managing the cultural and linguistic diversity enumeration strategy for the South Australia.

As a data analyst in the NMSU, I have been involved in numerous activities that cover both ends of the technical spectrum. The main responsibilities of the NMSU are the development of new statistics to meet identified program and information needs of Government and to provide statistical coordination to improve migrant data quality and comparability.
