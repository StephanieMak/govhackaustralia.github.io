I work at Main Roads in the Traffic Congestion Management Program. The program has two primary objectives; (1) reducing journey times on Perth's freeways and main arterial routes and (2) improving journey time reliability. I monitor the implementation of all our projects, using extensive amounts of financial data, as well as preparing visualisations in programs such as Tableau. I work with a dynamic team as the public are very passionate about the topic of congestion. I love to find new ways to use technology to identify trends and solve problems!
