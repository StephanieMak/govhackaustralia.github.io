I've been working with the Water Corporation as a Spatial Analyst and ROV Pilot Technician. Mapping inspection data of water pipes, everything from internal CCTV video of water mains using robotics vehicles built in-house to utilising Drones to inspect aboveground water main with high resolution imagery. My focus is on Condition Assessment of Water Corporation assets.
