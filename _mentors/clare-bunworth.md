Hello my name is Clare and I work at the ABS National Data Acquisition Centre in Geelong. I play a role in ensuring open communication and coordination of several business surveys that are run by the ABS in my current job as a Business Survey Project Manager.

My previous roles include address data specialist for the 2011 Census and a spatial data officer.

Outside of work I enjoy hiking, yoga, and travel (I have travelled to 35 countries across Europe, Africa, the Carribean and Asia).
