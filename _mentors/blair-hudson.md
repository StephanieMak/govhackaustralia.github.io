I completed my Bachelor of Information Technology at Macquarie University in 2013. In my final year, I discovered the world of data analytics through my PACE project with EY (Ernst & Young). After graduating, I joined EY’s Enterprise Intelligence team and there gained valuable experience solving client challenges with data, and refined skills for deconstructing problems, analytical modelling and storytelling with visualisations. Now I’m working with Pepper, at the intersection of innovation and data science, applying my skills to help meet unmet customer needs in new ways.
