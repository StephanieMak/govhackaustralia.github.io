I'm the Business Owner of the ATO's Operational Analytics application which supports the automated creation of discretionary workload for 12,000 ATO staff.  We are scheduled to operate on an automated, real-time basis. As at July 2016, OA runs consistently on-time. The peak performance has been 100% in a string of months from July - October 2015.
Because it operates real-time, its been about compressing time-scales for days to minutes ...  Empower, enable, connect.
Schedule like an Airline, transact like Bank Apps
