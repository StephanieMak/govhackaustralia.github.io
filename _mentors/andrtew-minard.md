My name is Andrew and I am originally from the United States.  I have been working as an environmental consultant for 5 years at Golder Associates in Melbourne.  Specifically, I specialize in 3D visualization and geological modeling using a variety of programs (Arc-GIS, GOCAD, Leapfrog, etc) from a variety of different datasets.  I work with many types of data including water, soil, air, chemistry and geological data sourced from public and private data sets.  My primary passion is using visualisation to help convey complex data in an easy way that is meaningful for our clients.
