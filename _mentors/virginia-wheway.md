I'm trained as a statistician / data miner and spent several years working for Boeing in Seattle. The best part of that job was being awarded a US patent for an algorithm I invented using real time "black box" data to predict the health of an aircraft. Since returning to Australia I've held several management roles at Boeing in the R&D and sustainability/carbon space. From Boeing I moved to the role of General Manager of  Transport for NSW's Bureau of Transport Statistics. I've now moved into consulting and like to stay connected with universities and schools and give lectures on interesting problems that have been solved using maths and stats throughout my career. I love all things numbers and bringing data to life.
