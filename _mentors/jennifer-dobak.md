I am an advocate for making available, relevant, timely and fit for purpose data to underpin sound evidence based decision making.
 
I have over 20 years experience working at the ABS, initially developing skills in survey methodology, in particular, in the design of household surveys. My more recent work at the ABS involves data integration and making more use of the information held in existing Government administrative data sets. I find the recent Government initiatives around data sharing and making data more accessible in the public domain exciting and timely.
