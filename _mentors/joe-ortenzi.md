As well as half of the dynamic duo heading up the popular Sydney Chapter of IxDA, I have worked in the digital space since the mid 90â€™s when a 28k modem was considered a "blisteringly fast" internet connection. Since then I have continuously worked as a user-centred advocate, through designer, coder, Interaction Designer, usability expert, technologist or, as at present, UX Architect for a large software company serving Government, Financial and Utility markets. Let me help you get your ideas closer to a usable interface.

### Ask me about

User flow, Design thinking, User testing, Accessibility, Prototyping, Information architecture, UX Design, Service design, Interaction design, Product design, Inclusive design, and help getting to testable, workable iterations efficiently. 

I am also open to be a remote mentor for other locations.
