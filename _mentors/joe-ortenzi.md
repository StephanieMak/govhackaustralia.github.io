As well as half of the dynamic duo heading up the popular Sydney Chapter of IxDA, I have worked in the digital space since the mid 90's when a 28k modem was the only way to internet.
Since then I have continuously worked as a user-centred anything, from designer, coder, usability expert, technologist or, as at present, Leading Experience Design for a large Software company serving government, Financial and Utilities.

I am also open to be a remote mentor for other locations.
