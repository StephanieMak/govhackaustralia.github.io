Hello everyone! I wear a few hats:

1. I am the founder of [Hackathons Australia](http://www.hackathonsaustralia.com) where we list hackathons happening in your state. There is almost 900 people on our Facebook group so [join our community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonsaustralia/). I have participated in over 30 hacks and counting! We are organising GovHack Sydney so please say HI to me!
2. I work at Schneider Electric, a power management and automation company. Marketing is my specialty but I have a strong background in PR.
3. I've completed a UX course at Academy Xi so can help formulate ideas and structure a great pitch.
