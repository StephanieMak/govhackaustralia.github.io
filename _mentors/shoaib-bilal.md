I am a graduate at IBM, fresh out of uni and am brimming with excitement just as you are. In my one year at IBM, I have become lead API developer for our Nao robot, which we have made "Cognitive!". My work has enabled me to travel to Korea and Singapore to show off the robot and train other IBMers on API development and working with the IBM Bluemix platform.
