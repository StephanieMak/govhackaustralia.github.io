I am a Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering Graduate working at IBM as a Graduate Consultant! During my time at IBM I gained invaluable experience in Web Development and some of the services that we offer within the Consultant Space, I currently work in Cloud Delivery where we focus on Automation. In my previous rotation, I used IBM Bluemix to deliver an innovative solution to my team to improve efficiency!

I also possess varied experience from Electrical, Electronics through to embedded Engineering experience thanks to my Undergraduate degree! I have also worn the computer systems engineer hat during my time at Monash University!
