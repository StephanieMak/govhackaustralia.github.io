I lead, manage and suffer sleepless nights delivering projects that contribute to the effective decision making and sound operational management across TfNSW by providing analysis, reports, advice, and performance metrics on Road Network Analysis. My goal is to make the information accessible, available and interactive. "Bring me that PDF" said nobody ever!

Working with a team of brilliant analysts, I provide strategic interpretation and advice on crucial aspects of network performance by undertaking analysis and modelling to communicate to stakeholders the results of public investment in RMS. I also provide appropriate contextual information and reports to specific issues being presented to different audiences including media and ministerial and parliamentary enquiries.
