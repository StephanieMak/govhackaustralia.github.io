Day-to-day I lovingly tend the Western Australian government's open data portal data.wa.gov.au. I'm also part of the SPUR team at Landgate, where we're building a location and innovation hub to stimulate and accelerate novel new businesses and ideas in the location technology space.

Specifically I can help you with finding datasets from across WA government; how to use SLIP's APIs and services; the world of geospatial standards, datasets, and APIs; applying location technology to web and mobile mapping; web development and architecting online services.
