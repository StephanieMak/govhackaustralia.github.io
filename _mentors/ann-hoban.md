I believe city life is rich and rewarding when people are connected, where imagination and experimentation are welcome, where value is created, not just acquired and where no-one is left behind. 

 Building a highly skilled team, I have supported and delivered creative spaces for artists, affordable work space for entrepreneurs, technology to make our city accessible and welcoming, events and spaces that bring communities together and the world to Sydney. This has only been possible through partnerships with government, peak business and community organisations, communities and individuals. We are all in this together. 

 I am interested in how imagination and technology can create a rich, equitable city life.
