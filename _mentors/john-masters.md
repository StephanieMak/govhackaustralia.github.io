I graduated last year with a BCom (economics major) after completing a part time course as a mature age student. I currently work in Wage Price Index (WPI) section of the ABS involved in the analysis of data that produces a key economic indicator used in government and economic policy. This career change was preceded by a thirty year engineering career.
