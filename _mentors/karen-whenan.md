Love innovation and exploring ideas! My perfect role would be working in an ideas laboratory but my actual role, is Director of Settlement Systems.  Have broad IT experience including business analysis, project and change management.  I'm looking forward to exploring creative ways people can use settlement and other information to develop new solutions to compliment existing settlement services.
