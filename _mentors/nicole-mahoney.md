I've been working at BOCSAR for 5 years as the Spatial Analyst. I have a degree and honours in Geospatial Information Systems. I majored in Criminal Justice. 
My role at BOCSAR involves spatial data management, data quality, hotspot and rate mapping, as well as ad hoc map requests using criminal incident data.
