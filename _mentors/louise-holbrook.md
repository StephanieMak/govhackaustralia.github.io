After a stint in the Department of Water GIS and mapping team I moved to the Water Corporation to protect drinking water sources (often from development, mining, housing and recreation). Both of these roles used a lot of state government datasets defining land, water, environmental or land use characteristics. 

I now work at the Water Corporation in the Wastewater recycling team, where we manage the risks associated with and locations for disposing water from our wastewater treatment plants around the state. This includes using wastewater for growing crops, irrigating public spaces and environmental disposal.
