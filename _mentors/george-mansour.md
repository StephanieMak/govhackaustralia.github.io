I have been working in the Spatial Industry for over 20 years.  Started working as a cartographer in a team of 2.  We were awarded an international excellence award by ESRI for creating an automated statewide mapping at a usable scale and size.  I am now managing a spatial data distribution team and manage the metadata for the department.  I make sure that data distributed along with the metadata is current and as accurate as it can be at the time.  I am familiar with almost all the data stored in the departments corporate libraries, its applications and resources for distribution of spatial data.
