I'm a Graduate developer at the Australian Bureau of Statistics. After studying pure maths and computing at university, I came to the ABS in the hope of finding some real numbers to play with and the chance to learn everything I can about the Census. I'm temporarily doing imputation testing in preparation for the Census, but most of the time I'm working on web development. My hobbies involve problem solving and learning about 'big data'.
