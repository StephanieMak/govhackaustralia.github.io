I am a technical leader with 25 years of experience in software design and engineering. I am an advocate for open source, agile software methodologies, DevOps, cloud computing and the open web. Working in leadership roles with many organisations has allowed me to gain a tremendous amount of expertise building teams and delivering large scale products and services and has afforded me opportunities to share my enthusiasm for technology and how it can provide amazing experiences.
