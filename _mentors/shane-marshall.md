Originally trained as a Land Surveyor (also with an IT degree), I've spent some time in coal mines, trekked around the country capturing and validating topo map data; dabbled in a bit of GIS programming and remote sensing image analysis in the natural resource management space; worked in data management, information policy and governance; led technology and business intelligence strategies; previously a product owner for a couple of flagship Qld Government customer facing digital services.  I'm an agile advocate and general information sharing supporter!
