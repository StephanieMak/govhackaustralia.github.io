Currently I am working as a project officer in the Healthcare Associated Infection Unit for the Communicable Disease Control Directorate. My role includes database management, data analysis, and federal/state performance reporting. I also assist in infection control policy and planning for WA public hospitals, which includes extensive involvement in the epidemiology, surveillance, and management of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Western Australia.

I have a strong background in the field of molecular genetics, especially the diagnosis  of viral and bacterial pathogens, and phylogenetic analysis.
