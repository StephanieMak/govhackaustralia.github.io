Although a Deputy Principal, I have a history or working as a ICT Coordinator. I have a passion for promoting and encouraging activities that promote Digital technologies and higher order thinking skills.

I also have a background of teaching Multimedia. I look forward to working with teams on filtering the data and coming up with ideas for a successful business pitch.
