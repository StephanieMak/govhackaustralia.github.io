I'm a research scientist and data centre manager at the Australian Antarctic Division. I do integration and syntheses of data in areas such as ecosystem modelling, conservation planning and risk assessment, animal tracking, ecology, complex systems, machine learning, and remote sensing. I also work with the Atlas of Living Australia on data access, analysis, and visualisation.
