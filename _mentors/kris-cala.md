I am an SES Band 1 (Branch Manager) officer in the Department of Social Services.  I have been an Australian Public Servant for more than 25 years and have worked at the Department of Social Services (DSS) for 2.5 years, having joined in November 2013.   

In my current role as Branch Manager, Settlement Policy, I and my team are responsible for developing and implementing a wide range of settlement policies  relating to humanitarian entrants and migrants, with a particular current focus on improving economic and social participation for humanitarian entrants, especially sustainable employment outcomes.   

Before joining DSS, I had various roles in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, including managing overseas visa offices in Belgrade, Paris and New Delhi.  I have also spent some time living in Beirut (Lebanon) and Budapest (Hungary).  In 2011 I was awarded a Public Service Medal for my role as Counsellor Immigration at the Australian High Commission in New Delhi from 2008 to 2011.  

I have a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree from the University of Sydney and a diplÃ´me d'Ã©tudes approfondies (Diploma of Advanced Studies) from the University Paris VIII in Paris, France.  I speak French very well and have a working knowledge of Polish - but I am interested in all languages as well as cinema and theatre.   

I am looking forward to being a GovHack 2016 mentor, because I am sure there will be some useful and interesting results that will assist to provide more support for new migrants and humanitarian entrants to settle into life in multicultural Australia!
