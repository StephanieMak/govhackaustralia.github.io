I program in SAS and get a tremendous sense of enjoyment when mashing data sets together. I have worked for the Australian Bureau of Statistics for six years, and have come across many interest types of data, from the obvious (Census data) to the obscure (do ask!).

I also enjoy long walks on the beach.
