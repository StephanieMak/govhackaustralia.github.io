Greg has extensive experience within both the public and private sectors as a marketer, strategist, policy writer, analyst and IT manager. Greg joined the Department of Treasury and Finance in 2007 and has primarily been involved in developing and promoting the tools that support government and industry to make better informed decisions. His latest challenge is to enable the public access to open government data so that it can support research and education, promote innovation, improve productivity and stimulate growth in the Victorian economy. He is also enhancing the sharing of, and access to, information-rich resources to support evidence-based decision making in the public sector.
