With over 9 years of experience at IBM, I have been exposed to our business ecosystem, including SME's and what makes then successful.  IBM promotes its executives taking business leadership roles.  Accordingly, I have been on the advisory board of a start up, Ecospectral in Canberra which includes coaching and mentoring the Founder/CEO as well us providing perspectives on business and sales strategies, understanding the client, value propositions and seeking eternal advice and support through innovation networks and capital raising.
