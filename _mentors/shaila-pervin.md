I have completed PhD in IT from Monash University on December, 2013 and currently I am working as a Research Staff Member at IBM, Melbourne since February, 2014. My major involvement till to date is related to Watson based client engagements. Apart from that I am a Hackathon enthusiast and love to work on solution design and development for mobile and smartwatch applications based on my personal interest.
