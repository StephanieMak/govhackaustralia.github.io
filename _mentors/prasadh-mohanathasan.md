I'm a Statistical Analyst with RMS. My work mainly involves developing web-based tools to visualise Traffic and Speed information for major routes around NSW. This means that I spend time analysing data in databases using SQL, developing back-end processes to retrieve the data using PHP and delivering the information in an easy-to-read format using Javascript.
