Infrastructure specialist & software developer, co-founder of Sydney Gamers League and the founder of the first disaster/humanitarian video blog that, on the day of the boxing day tsunami, the world turned to for up-to-date information.

Geoffrey is a cross-platform mobile software developer that uses Xamarin to deliver high-quality native applications. With Xamarin, applications are written entirely in C# or F#, sharing the same core library code on iOS, Android & Windows Phone. Anything you can do in Objective-C, Swift or Java, you can do in .NET with Xamarin to create beautiful native apps.

As part of constant and never ending learning, Geoffrey is actively engaged in contributing to the .NET ecosystem. Open-source for him is a way of life, when not authoring code you will find him building communities, passing down knowledge and mentoring first timers.
