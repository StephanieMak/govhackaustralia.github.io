I'll be at GovHack in an official capacity for Transport for NSW, but have been in the startup space for a while with a few of my own startups.  I'm also a mentor to early stage startups and have even participated (and came runner up!) at a hackathon last year so know what to look for and do during a hackathon.

I've been a product and project manager for years (too many!) in the digital space.  I can help you with working with 'our' data sets, I have a fascination about maps and analysis, can play with your app on Android or Apple (or mobile browser), do a great wireframe, draw a good architecture diagram (great with clouds!) and manage a team.  More importantly I can help you get a coffee or two or just a be shoulder to cry on at 2am to get you over the hump!
