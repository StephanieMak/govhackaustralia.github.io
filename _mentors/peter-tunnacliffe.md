I've performed a variety of roles in Taxation, predominantly around the Superannuation industry, with a focus on Risk and Intelligence.  I have also performed several non technical business analyst roles including mentoring staff on developing data queries and quality assurance on data outputs.  I have a very curious mind, with my latest interests including Identity theft/fraud, how data can be used for nefarious activity and developing my Viper capability.
