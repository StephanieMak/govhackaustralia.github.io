Over the past decade I've been applying design thinking to strategy and innovation in large organizations, working with corporate partners, academia and students. I'm a designer (current practice = business model design), a social entrepreneur (creative industries) and digital scale researcher, a project architect, long range planner, a fine artist (ceramics, painting, design) and an MBA with a passion for sustainability and creative culture. In the past two years I've been focused on future work force and future industries - our challenge - what does that look like? and imagining what it can be, especially for youth futures and collaboration models. I love spending time with family, friends, the ocean, classical singing and training with a talented reining horse.
