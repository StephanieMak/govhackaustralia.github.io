I have a background in scientific research and high-performance computing and am no stranger to dealing with big data solutions. In my day-to-day job with Elastic I wear many hats as a data wrangler, dev and ops guru helping Elastic users and customers get the most out of our Elastic stack by providing passionate and enthusiastic advice and support.
