Call me Dick. My current role is in the Wage Price Index at the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The amount of data collected by the ABS is staggering, so it's interesting to see how it can be used in innovative ways.

Outside of the ABS, I play football, so I'm more than happy to talk about how the AFL season is going at the moment.
