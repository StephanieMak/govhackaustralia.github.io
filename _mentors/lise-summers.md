This will be my third GovHack as a data mentor (I missed last year). I have over thirty years experience working in the cultural and humanities information fields, including local and State government. I'm interested in linked data, open data, and cultural data sets, as you can see by my blog https://inthemailbox.wordpress.com/.||My history research is a little bit of everything; from social history to urban and community history, with a touch of environmental and geographic history.||http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3839-0641
