I am just completing my first year as a graduate at IBM. I come from a science and mathematics background, completing my Honours in Astrophysics in 2014. While at IBM I have already worked on optical character recognition projects, database projects, robotics, IBM Watson and of course IBM Bluemix. Roles I have held within IBM include technical developer while integrating Bluemix API's with robots as well as their underlying applications.
