Hi, I'm Mat and I currently work in the Forms Design Team for the ABS, where I mainly work with our web forms. 
Until recently, I also worked in the Administrative Data Acquisition Unit, which involved a strong problem solving approach to handling how large and complex data sets can be brought into the ABS from a variety of sources.
