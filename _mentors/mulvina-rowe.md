I'm a Melbourne-based Entrepreneur and Project Manager with a Business and Science background. I'm a lover of food and all things environmental and would love to leave the planet in a better state than when we found it. 

I currently work for IBM in a graduate role as a Project Manager, where I manage projects for Energy Australia and Myer, but I've had lots of different jobs over the years and tonnes of experience in many different industries. I'm a big data nerd and love exploring the implications of what big data can do for us in the future to make the world a better, easier, happier place.
