I have been with DHS for 9 years working in various parts of IT and geospatial. Currently I work for the Strategic Information Division in the geospatial team developing digital products to improve our automation and advanced analysis.

I have also spent six months seconded to the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) working on information and knowledge management, geospatial, identity management and general development. 

I am in the process of moving to Geelong where I will be continuing my current 
role.

Not sure of the best way to help but am happy to help with whatever may be needed whether in the mentor sphere or other ways.
