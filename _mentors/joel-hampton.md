I've been an avid gamer since a very young age, from the day of Atari 2600 to PS4 and now all things VR. The hackathon focus on creating Games for Learning resonates with my passion in combining education and play. Learning should and could be fun.

Professionally, I've been a System Engineer in the two decades and just recently made a pivot into DevOps Engineering.
