I have extensive experience in a range of B2B and B2C marketing and digital based roles in Australia, the UK, and the US. I have worked across numerous industries including Real Estate, Financial Services, Legal, Energy & Utilities, Software, and the Public Sector.

My current role for Water Corp is focussed on creating and delivering a more effective and usable digital experience for customers, through web, mobile, content, social, and other digital and integrated channels.

Beyond work I love gaming, travel, sports, and Liverpool FC :)
