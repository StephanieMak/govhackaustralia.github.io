In my role at the Australian Bureau of Statistics, I've unleashed my inner data geek with a focus on business data and linking different diverse data sources (Business Tax, IPGOD, Business Survey data to name a few) together to build what is called the Expanded Analytical Business Longitudinal Database. This database is now being used by other Federal agencies to answer policy questions regarding business performance and productivity.||Outside of my working life, I'm slowly learning how to write Python so I can write an AI program to play board games and I play ultimate frisbee.
