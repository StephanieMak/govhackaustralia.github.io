I have over 15 years experience within the IT industry working as a senior manager of a large UX team, project manager, business analyst and most recently, consulting as a UX practitioner. I have worked with organisations large and small including: Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, Suncorp, Toyota, The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia as well numerous ambitious startups. 

I'm passionate about helping organisations create new sources of revenue and leapfrog competitors through innovation and the crafting of distinguished user experience design strategies. I enjoy working with organisations who are hell-bent on making a difference, shaking up industries and delivering greatness in ways no-one could anticipate.
