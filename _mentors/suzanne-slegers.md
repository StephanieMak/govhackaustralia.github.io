My background is marine science/geography and spatial information science.
I have been working with spatial data for the past 20 years on large, multidisciplinary environmental projects including rezoning the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Bioregional Assessments to name a few. I currently work for the Bureau of Meteorology in the Data Program. I am very keen on the operational use of data in applications to solve real world problems and inform policy.
