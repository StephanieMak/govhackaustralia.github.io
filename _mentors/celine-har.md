I work in the Data and Discovery team at the State Library of Western Australia. I mainly specialize in the maintenance of the Library Management System and have a background in Computer Science although I am more a code tweaker than a true programmer. 

I am reasonably familiar with the State Library of Western Australia's collections and how the records are structured as my team does data quality maintenance on a regular basis. Our collections are a treasure trove of data, but a key challenge is how to identify and make them available in a usable format.
