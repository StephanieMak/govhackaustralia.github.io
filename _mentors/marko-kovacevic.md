Intrigued by transport data and the analytics it drives, I am passionate about the intricacies of visualisation of such complex and multi layered information. My commitment is to improve the transport experience through providing better decision making abilities and harnessing the power of data to solve problems. 

I am a change focussed, part time perfectionist driven by the rapid change in technology, people's attention span and hard drive capacity.
