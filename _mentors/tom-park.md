Since graduating with a Master of Statistics , Analytics has been a core theme in my 20+ year career. Using data to solve problems is a passion that drives me to seekout and apply technology innovatively. In the new digital world, I aim to be a champion and an evangelist to the principle of "Evidence based Decision Making".
