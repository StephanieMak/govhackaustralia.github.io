Throughout my software engineering degree at the ANU, I have been involved in two start-ups companies. Accolade - a Digital Badge web-platform and PairFit - a mobile application exercise motivation.

I enjoy designing and creating user interfaces for the web and looking at interesting ways of displaying data and interacting with data.
