Hi I am Danielle. I have been a small and micro business mentor for the past 7 years. I currently manage a co-working space, innovation and lab space for businesses in South East Melbourne. Prior to that I was a family business owner of a company that distributes across Australia and New Zealand.
I specialise in on and offline marketing, online engagement, social media, innovation, customer delight and service, public speaking (and pitching) and lean business development in a growthhacking style.
