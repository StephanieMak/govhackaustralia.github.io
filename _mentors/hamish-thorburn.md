After recently completing a mathematics and statistics degree, I've started working for the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR). My role is as a research officer, which requires me to interpret data, build models and present/write up my findings. Outside of work, I'm a keen follower of sport, and a fan of card games.
