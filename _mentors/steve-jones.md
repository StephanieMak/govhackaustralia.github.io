Steve is a Director within the Science Division, Department of Science, Information Technology and Innovation, leading and directing the role, responsibilities, functions and resources of the Science Information Services.

The unit oversees the delivery of self-service information and data delivery systems to enable users to access Science information when and where necessary, including inventory and reporting tools (e.g., Qld wildlife information), customised reports and legislative and policy online maps on behalf of clients; and the Science Divisions contribution to Qld Government Open Data program.
