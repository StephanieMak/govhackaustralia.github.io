I started out as a surveyor with an interest in web GIS, which led me to a role in building a system based on open source technology (PostGIS,GeoServer,OpenLayers) for the company I worked for. Here I furthered my interest in IT into building field to office applications using wms and wfs.

Now I work for DELWP helping them build and run over 2000 open web services for the Victorian public.
