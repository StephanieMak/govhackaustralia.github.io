## Judging Criteria

All GovHack entries will be judged by the GovHack Competition Judging Panels against the following criteria:

* Mandatory elements submitted in Hackerspace on time

* relevance to the prize category description 

* specific prize eligibility criteria detailed (if any) e.g. data use

* originality of concept 

* civic value 

* visual design and usability 

* degree to which open data has been used 

* technical or creative skills demonstrated 

## Judging

The GovHack competition judges will choose all winners. The judging panels for prizes will consist of a mix of GovHack organisers, government agency representatives and industry sponsors as appropriate for each prize. All Submission elements detailed in "Submitting your entry" section of this document must be completed by the required time. No requests for extensions will be considered. Final arbiter is the judging panel whose decision is final. No correspondence will be entered into. This is a competition of skill. Chance plays no part in this competition. Judges are not eligible to compete for prizes and can not judge teams where a conflict of interest may arise.

## Winners and Awards

Each winning team must nominate one person to liaise with and provide their details to GovHack organisers following prize announcements to coordinate distribution of prizes after the event and prize money must be evenly split between all team members of winning teams. If all members of your team are under 18 then please nominate a guardian or the Local Event Organsier who will facilitate the purchase of vouchers to be split winnings amongst the team.

Some local prizes may be handed out on the Sunday afternoon, but most prizes will be announced at Region Awards nights or the National  Red Carpet Awards. 

The Red Carpet Awards also present a great opportunity to celebrate all the clever projects from around the country with sponsors, agencies, media and some high profile special guests!

 After GovHack, a limited number of  participants who demonstrate real GovHack Spirit and a finalists from each location will be chosen to fly to the awards. More details to be advised after the main event.
