## Prepare your video

* An important part of your project is the 3 minute video showing your hack in action that you’ll make to show off your project to the competition judges.

* We recommend you make a storyboard to help plan you video

* The preferred method is to use a screencast with a voice-over narration explaining your hack, why you created it, and what is being show in the video. Remember that the judging panel is viewing the videos in isolation and doesn’t necessarily have any context around your project.

* You may mix in other elements with the screencast, such as footage demonstrating the issues your hack addresses, interviews, live action material and actors (read: team members and bribeable friends)! you’ve filmed, et cetera - but be aware that videos that don’t primarily focus on showing off the hack itself will not be as valued as ones that do.

* You are encouraged to include your team name, event location, team members, and to talk about the data you have used and your data reuse story.

* Videos can be a maximum 3 minutes long. 

* Your video should not take more than a few hours out of your weekend if you keep it simple.

## Storyboarding, screencasting, and editing

* To help with storyboarding your video grab this huge pack of [free storyboarding illustrations](https://dribbble.com/shots/1083617-430-FREE-storyboard-illustrations).

* For screencasting check out software like [Screenr](http://www.screenr.com/) and [ActivePresenter](http://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/free-edition/) that will allow you to record demos of your application.

* For mixing clips together the [YouTube Video Editor](https://www.youtube.com/editor) is super user-friendly; though [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlmc) or [LWKS](http://www.lwks.com/) may also be handy.

* Videos can be uploaded directly to our S3 storage bucket via the HackerSpace (we’ll upload them all to YouTube later). You can use YouTube, Vimeo, et cetera as well.

### **Audio**

* One of the challenges teams often have is finding a quiet place to record audio. 

* Scripts often need to be recorded several times to fit with the video footage and edited accordingly.

* Music is a nice touch but make sure you are licenced to use content :)

### **Submitting your video**

* Make sure you allow at least 1 hour to submit your video.   

* As soon as you have the URL to the video, add this to your Project Page.  

*  Remember you must have the actual URL of the video on your project page and not  a link to another website where you have embedded the video. This is an important element used to validate the video submitted by the deadline.
