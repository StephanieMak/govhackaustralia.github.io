GovHack Toowoomba is back for our 2nd year!!!

Join us for 46 hours to explore, mash up, ideate and communicate your concepts using open Government data...to win glory (and maybe even some $$$).

GovHack is for every one! All sorts of people join GovHack, including entrepreneurs, developers, data analysts, engineers, designers, digital media creators, artists, film makers, story tellers, academics, researchers, youth and civic society enthusiasts!

Previous years entries have included, art, jewelery, a digital sign, a board game, historic film pieces, a virtual reality game, a 3d model, a visualization of data, an informed article and of course some amazing web apps!

The best teams have a mix of skills to help contribute to all the competition elements including skills to story boarding ideas, build prototypes and create a video pitch of your winning idea! Don't have a team...don't worry, you can join a team when you get here!

Last year, a few lucky local representatives from GovHack Toowoomba were recognised at State and National level, including receiving flights and accommodation to the GovHack Red Carpet Awards. This could be you this year!!!

We provide the data, food and wifi...you bring your laptop & imagination and create to your heartâ€™s content, for glory, or money, or both!
