GovHack comes to Ipswich and Fire Station 101!

GovHack is a weekend where creatives and designers, developers and programmers, entrepreneurs and business leaders, and anyone with a keen interest in data join forces to make a difference using freely available open source data.

You can bring your own team, and many teams will be created on the day. 

Some teams may create working prototypes, while others my find ways to better visualise the data. We work with the skills and strengths in the room to help everyone get the most out of the weekend.

We provide data, food, and wifi. You bring your laptop and ideas. Collectively, we will make a difference and have fun in the process!

### Digital City Theme Node

This year's theme is Digital City, with a focus on social outcomes. How can open data be used for a positive social impact in Ipswich, in our cities across Australia, and perhaps the world? 

Bring your personal passions and perspectives to focus available data on challenges and opportunities that are important to you!
