Youth are welcome at the event during these shorter opening hours and will have adequate supervision and assistance from organisers, volunteers and mentors. Outside of the shorter opening hours youth are able to remain however a guardian is required to be present at all times.

### Child Safety Commitment

GovHack Brisbane Youth Node is committed to providing services to young people to assist them in expressing their interest in unlocking the potential of data, innovation and entrepreneurism. We are committed to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all young people and will endeavour to provide a safe and supportive environment for young people by ensuring event organisers and volunteers assisting with GovHack and interacting with youth participants hold Blue Cards having had a Working with Children check performed by Blue Card Services or hold exempt Blue Card status (e.g. registered teachers). Organisers and volunteers without Blue Cards will work with mature participants or under the supervision of Blue Card holders.

The Youth Node takes place at the University of Queensland, a registered educational provider. The Youth Node will meet requirements as set out by the University of Queensland for working with youth.
