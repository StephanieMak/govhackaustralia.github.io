Come join us at GovHack FNQ. A govhack event focused on Tourism & Hospitality in Tropical Queensland. With over 2 million international and domestic tourists a year visiting Cairns and the Far North it has the ability to be the home to many innovative Tech Startups.

GovHack gives us the opportunity to understand how these publicly available Data Sets can further improve new and existing businesses in the region through the development of new startups while fueling the current fireups.

GovHackFNQ 2016 will be held at The Spaceâ€™s new location at Cairns Tafe in beautiful sunny and hot Tropical Queensland. Where else would you want to do GovHack?

### Theme event: Tourism and Hospitality

Tourism & Hospitality industry is the theme for GovHackFNQ

With our local tourism market heavily favouring the international market GovHack FNQ is in an ideal position to capitalise on the multi-lingual nature of of our international arrivals. 

With over 2 million international and domestic tourists a year visiting Cairns and the Far North have a real advantage in the development of short stay apps such as AirBnB. Cairns is also the ideal base for building logistical/travel management systems in the international sense of the word. 

Our city with its international airport so close to town makes it an ideal flyin/flyout market for idea developers and techheads alike who enjoy building their dreams in the Tropical North & Barrier Reef Tourism Market.
