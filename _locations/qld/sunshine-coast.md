Welcome to GovHack Sunshine Coast 2016! This event is for everyone and anyone who has an idea about how we can strengthen our local communities.

If you have digital skills, we want you! If you have a community/commercial problem to solve, we want you! If you just want somewhere to hang out and eat pizza for 46 hours from Friday 29th - Sunday 31st July, then WE WANT YOU!

Registration is Free! WiFi is Fast and Free! Food is Free! Come and explore the opportunities for new products and services based on open data sets – combine data - and create cool stuff! We have many passionate, creative and talented people on the Sunshine Coast and we are looking forward to seeing you all!

GovHack is an annual, national competition with local, state, national and international prize monies to be won. This year, our focus is on community, commercialisation and collaboration. GovHack Sunshine Coast is not just a competition, it’s a vision for a more effective democracy and public service in Australia.

Special thanks to our local sponsors Noosa Council, Sunshine Coast Council, Regional Development Australia, Unity Water and University of the Sunshine Coast. As a result of their generous support, we are pleased to be able to offer multiple local prize categories each with $1000 cash for the winning participants.

Also, special thanks to our venue sponsor Spark Bureau for providing us with a place to call home for the weekend!

In addition, our sponsors are committed to working with participants after the weekend to ensure that all innovative ideas get what they need to get off the ground. Look forward to seeing you at Spark Bureau on Ocean Street for a great event! Until then, keep in touch and tweet us @GovHackSC or get our attention by using our hashtag #GovHackSC
