There is surely not a more beautiful location than the Gold Coast to bring together people from all walks of life to hack something amazing. 
For a number of years, the official Gold Coast event has brought teams together to create something cool, useful and awesome with open government data to better their local community.

The Gold Coast is a hugely diverse and growing regional centre, with tens of thousands of students, millions of tourists and thousands businesses taking advantage of the area. With beaches next to high density business and living areas stretching back to the hinterland, there is opportunity to improve any number of areas. Over the next couple of years, the Gold Coast will play host to millions of people and disruptions in the economy with the 2018 Commonwealth Games and growing infrastructure. All of these people, whether business owners, employees, tourists, students, athletes or academics, can have their lives improved through disruptive and innovative open government data hacks.

With both the City of Gold Coast and Queensland Government committed to open data, innovation, entrepreneurship and digital economies, there is no better time or place to begin the journey into digital disruption and open data hacking. We can't wait to see you here.
