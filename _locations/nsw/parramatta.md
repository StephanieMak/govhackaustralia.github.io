Do you like designing? Working with data? 
Perhaps you like developing mobile apps, games, web sites?
And you probably love helping people too!? Great!

You're going to really enjoy GovHack. It's where designers, developers and data gurus work together over a weekend to create applications, visualisations and tools from data sets provided by local, state and federal government agencies. There are big prizes to be won, and participating in GovHack looks fantastic on your resume. You don't have to be super technical, although it helps - but we need your ideas, passion and energy.
