Hackathon n00bie? Welcome! Here’s what you can expect.

You’ll be teamed up with some new buddies from various industry backgrounds and given a bunch of open data and tools. It’s up to your team how you use what you have to make something out of it in a very short period of time: 48 hours. Sound daunting? You’ll be amazed how quickly things can happen when you have a team of excited and creative smarties and no strong rules about what your creation has to do. As well as getting to meet and work with new people on new things - there will also be a chance to keep the momentum going after the hack, with winners getting prizes and entry to the next stage of the competition.

This is no ordinary hack! It’s at Boomworks.

Once again, Boomworks is hosting a #GovHack Camperdown node. We have a roomy open plan office with plenty of spaces to get you thinking and building. Having hosted last year’s GovHack and HealthHack, mentored for Samsung’s Adappt weekend, and recently (ahem) being placed in the top 25 projects worldwide for NASA’s recent Spacehack - it feels safe to say that Boomworks kinda likes these hackathon thingies. 

Boomworks will have markers, post it notes, paper and whiteboards available for teams over the 3 days. All attendees will need to have their own computer equipment.
