What is GovHack?

GovHack is a 47 hour hackathon focused on using open data released or hosted by the Government (and related/similar institutions eg Universities). On Friday the 29th of July you will arrive and receive information about the available data sets. You will then join a team, formulate an idea and spend the next 47 hours taking it from scratches on paper to a functioning masterpiece. At the end you will submit some material to help judging – a few words and a short screencast/video. Prizes are then announced a few weeks later.

But what if I’m not a hacker/programmer/developer?!

Fiddlesticks. We’re all hackers in some way. And besides, GovHack teams require much more than just technical ability to win. They need people who can:

Analyse data accurately and help others in the team understand it (scientists, historians, sociologists, doctors etc)
Document and create copy to help the world understand why this project deserves to win (journalists, copywriters, photographers etc)
Design the interface or create the digital assets (designers, artists, illustrators etc)
You don’t have to be an expert. Your skills don’t need to relate to something you do at work or at home. GovHack is first and foremost a place to share knowledge. GovHack teams – above all else – need thinkers.

What do I need to bring?

GovHack is a sponsored event and so all food, drinks and other consumables will be fully catered. This being Tassie, the food is always pretty great. The GovHack organisers go out of their way to work with interesting smaller businesses in the state, rather than going for the usual catering companies, Subway and Dominos fare. That said, what won't be provided (with a few exceptions) is equipment, so if you need your laptop, drawing tablet, iPad, or any other piece of kit, you'll want to bring that along with you to the event. Also, as it's a 24-hour event, you might like to bring a sleeping bag or something similar in case you want to have a snooze at some point.

Do I need to stay for the whole 47 hours?

Not at all! In fact, traditional GovHack wisdom dictates that you'll probably build a better product if you go home and get some sleep and don't stretch yourself too thin. We have provisions in place for people who want to stay overnight at the venue, and venue access will be available through the night, but if you don't live far away, you'll probably find you have a better experience overall if you duck home for some real sleep each night.

Where’s GovHack happening in Launceston?

GovHack Hobart 2016 will be held in the Battery Shed in Launceston, near the Queen Victoria Museum in Inveresk.  You can find parking nearby at the Launceston City Council carpark outside the Museum (near Blue Cafe).

What if I’m not in Launceston?

There’s another GovHack venue in Hobart, so if you’re one of our fellow hackers in the south of the state, you might find it’s more convenient to participate in that event. We’ve had plenty of people travel for GovHack in the past and people from out of town are always welcome.
