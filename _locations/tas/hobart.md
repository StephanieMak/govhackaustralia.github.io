 What is GovHack?

GovHack is a 47 hour hackathon focused on using data released or hosted by the Government (and related/similar institutions eg Universities). On Friday the 3rd of July you will arrive and receive information about the available data sets. You will then join a team, formulate an idea and spend the next 47 hours taking it from scratches on paper to a functioning masterpiece. At the end you will submit some material to help judging – a few words and a short screencast/video. Prizes are then announced a few weeks later.

But I’m not a hacker/programmer/developer?!

Fiddlesticks. We’re all hackers in some way. And besides, GovHack teams require much more than just technical ability to win. They need people who can:

Analyse data accurately and help others in the team understand it (scientists, historians, sociologists, doctors etc)
Document and create copy to help the world understand why this project deserves to win (journalists, copywriters, photographers etc)
Design the interface or create the digital assets (designers, artists, illustrators etc)
You don’t have to be an expert. Your skills don’t need to relate to something you do at work or at home. GovHack is first and foremost a place to share knowledge. GovHack teams – above all else – need thinkers.

The Venue

GovHack Hobart 2015 will be held in the Factoryfloor coworking space on the ground floor of the Old Mercury Building on the corner of Argyle and Macquarie Streets. We have a fantastic space with numerous meeting rooms that can be used by teams along with a large communal area.
