On 29 – 31 July 2016, the Government of South Australia will once again run the Unleashed Open Data Competition in partnership with the City of Onkaparinga. Unleashed is the South Australian part of GovHack, the annual International Open Data competition held across Australia and New Zealand. 

Now in its fourth year, Unleashed is a competition which draws together government, industry and the community, to reuse non-sensitive government ‘open’ data in new and innovative ways to benefit South Australia. 

Each year the Unleashed events attract over 200 participants from across the state. Participants include entrepreneurs, developers, engineers, designers, digital media creators, artists, story tellers, academics, researchers and open data enthusiasts. 

Continuing again this year, NexGen Unleashed will have dedicated prizes for competitors 13-18 years of age. Venues will have child safe environment policies and volunteers in place.

This year Seaford library will be the venue for: Unleashed where we hope to attract competitors aged 13-18 years; and the new The Arts Unleashed – Storytellers, encouraging film makers, historians, game designers, marketers and visual artists to use Open Data to create works of art that tell a story in any form.

Over 46 hours, teams create a proof of concept and a video that tells the story of how the data can be reused. Many of the concepts are innovative community apps. There are also many entries that mash up data and display it in an informative visualisation, prototype electronic gadget, stories or a creative artistic display.
