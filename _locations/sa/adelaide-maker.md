On 29 – 31 July 2016, the Government of South Australia will once again run the Unleashed Open Data Competition in partnership with the University of South Australia. Unleashed is the South Australian part of GovHack, the annual International Open Data competition held across Australia and New Zealand.

In 2016, we are encouraging more makers and artists to participate by providing a Maker Space for making cool objects, gadgets or art. For this, UniSA is providing two awesome spaces to the maker competitors that will enable maximum creativity.

Over 46 hours, teams create a proof of concept and a video that tells the story of how the data can be reused. Many of the concepts are innovative community apps. There are also many entries that mash up data and display it in an informative visualisation, prototype electronic gadget, stories or a creative artistic display.

UniSA is offering Maker competitors two wonderful spaces to work in during the weekend:

• The Maker’s Studio in the Kaurna Building – lots of open space with room to move, enabling maximum creativity. Competitors are welcomed to bring their own equipment to these facilities as long as they do not require supervision.

• The Digital & Design Workshops in the Dorrit Black Building - dedicated facilities that will provide Unleashed competitors with unprecedented access to digital technologies, timber and metal machine areas, soft model workshop, hand tools and work benches.
UniSA technical staff will be supervising Unleashed teams throughout the weekend.

PLEASE NOTE: Unleashed competitors interested in using the Digital & Design Workshops must complete a one-hour compulsory induction prior to having access to these facilities. UniSA technical staff will conduct the induction sessions. Those sessions will be scheduled on the week prior to the competition. These areas have capacity restrictions so please register soon to secure your place.

Please email Anthony.vonderBorch@unisa.edu.au to register your interest in using the Digital & Design Workshops in the Dorrit Black Building. We will contact you to schedule the induction session.
