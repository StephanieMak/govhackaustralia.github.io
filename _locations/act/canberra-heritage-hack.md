Heritage Hack is a theme node focusing on the use of cultural heritage data. We'll be bringing together hackers and content specialists to explore new ways of working with digital collections. What could you make with 200 million newspaper articles, or millions of historical photographs? We're keen to find out!

Heritage Hack is hosted by the [Centre for Creative and Cultural Research](http://www.canberra.edu.au/research/faculty-research-centres/cccr) at the University of Canberra.
