After its huge success as a first year event in 2015, GovHack Geelong is back bigger and better than ever for its second year! Developers, designers, creatives, ideas people and thinkers - we're warmly welcoming you to participate, engage with our interesting and unique challenges, showcase your skills and be in the running to win fabulous prizes. 

We're holding GovHack Geelong this year in the same great location as last year - room D3.211 at Deakin University's architecturally stunning Waterfront Campus in the Geelong CBD. There's plenty of breakout space, we'll be providing some tasty internets and delicious food (or is that the other way around?!), and the location is stunning. The venue is easily accessible via public transport - it's a 10 minute walk from Geelong's main station, and there's parking nearby. 

GovHack Geelong is a great way to meet interesting new people, to learn new technical, user experience and ideation skills, and create value from our nation's vast untapped resources of open data. Moreover, GovHack Geelong is part of a range of initiatives helping transform Geelong into a knowledge economy-based, smart city of the future. 

Come join us and play with the future!
