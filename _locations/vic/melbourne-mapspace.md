    Trams: Trams will operate every 30 minutes on routes 19, 67, 75, 86, 96 and 109. This will provide wide coverage across Melbourne as well as servicing key night-time precincts and the major streets in the CBD grid. 
    Night bus network: Night buses will provide a revamped and improved bus service with around 20 overnight routes. The night bus network will have a mix of routes operating from the city, and others providing suburban connections from train stations and suburban night-time hubs. 
    V/Line: V/Line coaches will depart from Southern Cross Station around 2am, bound for Bendigo, Ballarat, Traralgon and Geelong.

The Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning (DELWP) is proud to host the GovHack MapSpace Node Event in Melbourne, a weekend event of innovation, inspiration and collaboration using open government spatial data. Over the weekend, teams will work to develop new location-based app’s and services, and find novel and enlightening ways to visualise complex information using the shared visual vocabulary of the map.

Whether you are a geo-geek, a creative, coder, analyst, developer, designer, student, professional or retiree, join us to meet new people, share your craft, and map the future.

Bring your own team or create a team on the day.

Some teams will create working prototypes, while others may find ways to visualise complex problems and point the way towards solutions. We celebrate everyone‘s skills and passions and help you get the most out of the weekend.

There will be food and fun, cash prizes, and fabulous mentors to help you along the way. We provide data, catering, wifi, and a space to create. You bring your laptops & your ideas.

The MapSpace node will be based in the Melbourne CBD at the beautiful Telstra Gurrowa Innovation Hub – a place designed for collaborative blue-sky thinking. It is close to public transport and some of Melbourne’s best open green spaces.

Come to connect with like-minded people, make a difference to the community and create solutions to tricky problems. 

 	The MapSpace node will focus on mapped and map-able government data, from common framework Vicmap datasets to more focused spatial datasets from across government.

Spatial data is information-rich and has a critical role in making sense of complex phenomenon and driving location intelligence. DELWP’s roles across planning and property titling, protecting our water and environmental resources, and preparing for and assisting communities during emergencies all leverage and contribute to geospatial services that deliver benefits across Victoria. At MapSpace we will celebrate the Spirit of GovHack by exploring and creating spatial information that connects, describes, and monitors our communities and resources.
