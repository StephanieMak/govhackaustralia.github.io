Welcome to "Hack for Wyndham", a hackathon to use open data and build some thing useful for the people of Wyndham and Victoria.   
 
Thousands of people travel everyday from Wyndham to the City in the morning and back in the evening. 

Travelling has been a hectic experience, bumper to bumper and takes double the time to get to City in peak hours. This node is dedicated to build something that will help all those who people who travel, by providing information.

Come lets build something useful for the people of Wyndham!
