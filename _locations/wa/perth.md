  parking: We're in the CBD so parking can be pricey. Public transport might be a better option.

GovHack is back in Perth for the fourth year!

This year we're moving to a bigger and better venue, so that our projects can be cooler and more awesome!

Come and join us at Flux over the weekend of 29 to 31 July to explore and tinker with government data. The outcome - well it's up to you. With dozens of prizes and over a hundred participants we're looking for awesome little hacks and major projects that can help government be better.
