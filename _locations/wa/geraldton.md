For the first time Geraldton is joining the GovHack party!

GovHack is about building awesome solutions to our governments' most pressing problems - we need to get some of our regional thinking into the mix.

This year we're holding the Geraldton GovHack at Pollinators, our own start-up hub in the Mid-West. So come on down to Pollinators over the course of the weekend of 29 to 31 July and help aspiring GovHackers like yourself help improve government!
