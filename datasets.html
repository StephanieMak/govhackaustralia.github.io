                These are the official datasets which will be used in the competition. To be listed as an official dataset a dataset must be submitted by a government agency for use during GovHack - either across the whole compeititon, or for specific prizes.

            <p>
                The competition details won’t be launched until GovHack opens on 29th July, but you can start checking out and playing with the data early so you can make the most of the GovHack weekend. Please do check out the competition rules as well and remember, it’s about showing what you can do during the GovHack weekend.
