            <p>
                These are the official datasets which will be used in the competition. To be listed as an official dataset a dataset must be submitted by a government agency for use during GovHack - either across the whole compeititon, or for specific prizes.
            </p>

            <p>
                All entries must use official data in some form. Some prize categories require you to use specific data from a publishing organisation. Other prize categories require a mix of data sourced from different government jurisdictions.
            </p>

            {% if site.datasets.size > 0 %}
                <p>
                    The competition details won’t be launched until GovHack opens on 29th July, but you can start checking out and playing with the data early so you can make the most of the GovHack weekend. Please do check out the competition rules as well and remember, it’s about showing what you can do during the GovHack weekend.
                </p>

                <p>
                    PLEASE NOTE: This list will be updated over the weeks leading up to GovHack and will only be finalised a few days before GovHack, so please keep checking back here for up to date information.
